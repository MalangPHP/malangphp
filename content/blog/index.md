### Creating Content

Phile is a flat file CMS, this means there is no administration backend and database to deal with. You simply create `.md` files in the "content"
folder and that becomes a page. For example, this file is called `index.md` and is shown as the main landing page.

If you create a folder within the content folder (e.g. `content/sub`) and put an `index.md` inside it, you can access that folder at the URL
`http://yousite.com/sub`. If you want another page within the sub folder, simply create a text file with the corresponding name (e.g. `content/sub/page.md`)
and you will be able to access it from the URL `http://yousite.com/sub/page`. Below we've shown some examples of content locations and their corresponding URL's:
